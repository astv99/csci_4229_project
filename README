- Description: 		First-Person Egyptian Environment

------------------
Technical Overview
------------------

3D environment created with OpenGL 2.0 using GLUT. Written in C and developed & tested on both Ubuntu Linux 14.04 LTS and Windows 7 (with MinGW).

The provided Makefile will compile the source on either Linux (via GCC) or Windows (via MinGW). For Windows, compilation and execution requires glut32.dll (provided) to be placed in the \windows\system32 folder.

Texture files were acquired from various library Web sites.

------------------------------------------
Unpacking & Compilation on Linux & Windows
------------------------------------------

1. Extract all files to a desired folder path (all are needed).
2. To compile & link, enter: 
	$ make
3. To run the program once built, enter:
	$ ./fp_ee
4. To delete the object file(s), enter:
	$ make clean

-----------------------------
User Interaction Instructions
-----------------------------

- Esc		: quit
- x/X 	: show/hide the coordinate axes (hidden by default)
- p/P		: enable/disable lighting effects

- +/-		: increase/decrease field of view (sky-view & 1st-person views)
- v/V		: reset field of view to default value of 75 (both views)
- f/F		: toggle sky-view vs 1st-person view

- w/W		: move (camera) forward		(only in 1st-person view)
- s/S		: move (camera) backward  	(only in 1st-person view)
- a/A		: strafe (camera) left  	(only in 1st-person view)
- d/D		: strafe (camera) right  	(only in 1st-person view)
- q/Q		: turn (camera) left  		(only in 1st-person view)
- e/E		: turn (camera) right  		(only in 1st-person view)

<Arrow Keys> : adjust view in appropriate direction (only in sky-view)

Time Taken

35-40 hours estimated.

References

C source code split into two files:

1. fp_ee.c (main & driver code)
1. fp_ee.h (header containing the scene render methods)

Portions of the code for this assignment were taken from various
in-class Example Programs.

Texture files must be in the same folder as the object file in order for it to run.

---------------------------
Work Completed - Highlights
---------------------------

+ Full-featured first-person-style navigation, with separate keys for
strafing and turning.

+ Lighting effects set to create a visual early-night mood, using four
light sources in the form of fire-based objects.

+ Includes both first-person and traditional "sky/god" views for
convenience in evaluating the scene.

+ Collision detection with all solid objects in the scene.
The user will not be able to "walk through" any objects, including the 
outside walls.
